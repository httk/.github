# *httk*

The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*) is a a toolkit for preparing and running calculations, analyzing the results, and storing results in global and/or personalized databases. The *httk* library and tools helps you run high-throughput computations on everything from your own laptop to high-performance supercomputers.

Our website is: https://httk.org/  
Our main code repository is: https://github.com/httk/httk

To aid the organization of our repositories, they are divided over three GitHub organizations:
- [httk](https://github.com/httk): our primary organization with repositories for the libraries and software tools. 
  This organization hosts the [httk main code repository](https://github.com/httk/httk), which probably is the only thing relevant to most users of *httk*.
- [httk-system](https://github.com/httk-system): software and tools for system and workstation administration that we use to manage our servers and work computers.
- [httk-web](https://github.com/httk-system): the repositories we use to manage all parts of the https://httk.org/ website.
