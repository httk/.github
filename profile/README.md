# *httk*

The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*) is a library and set of tools for running high-throughput computations on everything from your own laptop to high-performance supercomputers.

Our website is: https://httk.org/

To aid the organization of our repositories, they are divided over three GitHub organizations:
- (httk)[https://github.com/httk]: our primary organization with repositories for the libraries and software tools. 
  In particular: https://github.com/httk/httk -- out main code repository, which probably is the only thing relevant to most users of *httk*.
- (httk-system)[https://github.com/httk-system]: software and tools for system and workstation administration that we use to manage our servers and work computers.
- (httk-web)[https://github.com/httk-system]: a set of repositories that we use to manage the https://httk.org/ website.
